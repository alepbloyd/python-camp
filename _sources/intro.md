# Python Camp: Programming for Beginners

## What Is Python Camp?

Python Camp is a non-credit, hands-on, intensive mini-course offered by GW Libraries and Academic Innovation (GW LAI) for the GW community. Python Camp introduces foundational programming practice using the Python language, with a focus on building skill through both team-based activities and self-guided exercises. The aim is to expose participants to the core concepts of programming, while providing a sufficient foundation in Python syntax and programming patterns to allow participants to build upon their learning in other contexts. 

Participation is free for members of the GW community, though application is required. While we are not able to offer academic credit, participants who successfully complete Python Camp will receive a certificate of completion from GW LAI.

## Whom Is It For?

Participation is open to members of the GW community, but the course is designed for those without prior experience programming and who are not currently enrolled in a programming course at GW. If you have struggled to learn a programming language in the past but are motivated to try again, we encourage you to apply! Python Camp aims to foster an inclusive environment that is responsive to learners with diverse backgrounds, goals, and learning styles. Our approach to teaching focuses on practical, "real-world" examples, in a setting that emphasizes peer-to-peer collaboration and hands-on practice over lecture and theory. 

Previous Python Camp cohorts have included undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, and staff, representing a wide range of academic disciplines: public health, economics, bioinformatics, political science, engineering, business, anthropology, and many others. Hence our participants' goals have been diverse. But if you 
  - have a desire to work with data more efficiently, 
  - want to learn a modern, all-purpose programming language, 
  - enjoy a challenge,
  - and enjoy learning alongside others,
then Python Camp may be for you!

## Acknowledgments

Python Camp is made possible by the contributions and support of many present and former colleagues at GW LAI, including Daphna Atias, Debbie Bezanson, Alex Boyd, Rachel Burley, Ricky Graham, Dan Kerchner, Josh McDonald, Marcus Peerman, Robin Pokorski, Megan Potterbusch, Dolsy Smith, and Laura Wrubel.

The Python Camp curriculum draws inspiration from Professor Lorena Barba's OpenEdX course [Get Data Off the Ground with Python](https://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/course-v1:GW+EngComp1+2018/about), as well as the pedagogy and curricula of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
