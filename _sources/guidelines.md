# Collaborating on Code: Guidelines for a Good Experience

Python Camp takes a team-based approach to teaching and learning. Python Camp instructors work as a team and represent a range of coding experience, from folks who have written code almost daily for years, to folks to who do so more sporadically, to folks who only recently embarked on their coding journeys. 

As a Python Camp participant, you'll also be asked to work in a team. This document outlines the rationale for our team-based approach and offers guidelines and suggestions for making the most of this experience.

## Why Work in Teams?

Over the years of teaching Python Camp, we've found that the most effective environments are those where the learners interact not only with the instructors but with each other: asking a neighbor or friend for help with the lesson, talking through an exercise together, or even just sharing their goals for learning Python and their broader academic interests. In order to cultivate this kind of interaction, we have restructured Python Camp around a series of team-based, in-class activities. 

Moreover, we believe that working in teams fosters the following outcomes:

- Participants gain an opportunity to both learn **and** teach, which in turn deepens learning. Explaining a concept to someone else is one of the best ways of solidifying our own understanding of the concept.
- Participants engage in the material more actively when working together. The temptation to tune out or give up -- a normal response to challenging material -- is less salient when we are accountable to others in a group.
- Participants benefit from each other's perspectives and experiences. Different ways of approaching a problem enrich the space of possible solutions, and we can learn a lot from the way others think.
- Participants model the way code gets written in professional and academic settings. Whether we are writing software or conducting research, it's crucial to be able to communicate effectively with others about problems, proposed solutions, challenges, and processes.

In short, we write code for one another, not for the computer. It's a fairly trivial matter to write code that the computer understands. The hard part, the _art_ of programming, is to write code that proves useful for human beings, and that human beings can understand. (Think of a recipe: the recipe dictates what you do in the kitchen, but you don't follow a recipe for the sake of the kitchen; you follow a recipe in order to satisfy the appetites of the people you're trying to feed.)

## How Does It Work?

We'll assign you to a small team (of 3-4) and ask you to work with the same team for the duration of Python Camp. Each team should sit together at a table and work together on the in-class exercises, which are designed to involve brainstorming, discussion, and collaborative problem-solving as well as writing code. 

The following guidelines will help you have a positive team experience:

### Everyone participates

 When it comes to writing code, it's important that _everyone_ on the team take part. Writing code involves both conceptual understanding and muscle memory. The more lines of code you write (_i.e._, type), the more fluent you will become. 
 
 Each lesson/activity is an executable Python **notebook**. Each person on the team should open the notebook on their own computer in JupyterHub and write and run code in response to the activity prompts.
 
 There are four main kinds of prompts:
   - Those that ask you to **run** a line of pre-written code and interpret the result.
   - Those that ask you to write a line or two of code to perform a discrete action.
   - Those that ask you to make a plan or design as a team to solve a particular problem.
   - Those that ask you to write larger **blocks** of code to implement your team's solution.

For the first two kinds of prompt, the team should take a pause so that each team member can finish their work before moving on to the next prompt and/or diving into the discussion.

For the last two kinds of prompt, teams should feel free to explore different strategies for collaboration. 
  - For instance, a team of four _may_ prefer to work on the larger coding problems in pairs, to facilitate sharing screens. 
  - Or the team may decide to give everyone a chance to try the problem individually before comparing their proposed solutions. 

Finding what works best for your team is part of the process of teamwork. And your Python Camp instructors/facilitators are there to help! 

But whatever method(s) you choose, **please ensure that everyone on the team has a chance to enter the team's solution into their own notebook.** Besides practicing Python syntax, by keeping your notebook up to date you will create a useful artefact you can refer to later. 

### Team roles

#### Rotating notetaker

For the prompts that ask you to write code, everyone should be doing so in parallel in their own notebooks, even when that involves some duplication of effort: the point of these team activities is not to demonstrate your efficiency but your shared understanding.

For the prompts that involve planning, design and discussion, it will be useful to designate a single person as notetaker for that activity. **Please do rotate the role between activities** so that everyone on the team shares the responsibility. Taking notes is a useful way to reinforce your learning. But it can also prevent the notetaker from engaging fully in the discussion, so it's important to distribute the task equitably. 

Your Python Camp facilitators will remind you to rotate the notetaking task at the start of each major team activity.

#### Team facilitator

It's not necessary to delegate a leader for your team, given the highly structured activities of Python Camp. But if the team would be more comfortable choosing one member to moderate the discussion and keep things on track, you're welcome to do so. You might also consider rotating this role, so that everyone has a chance to contribute in every way. 

### Homework

In addition to the in-class team activities, Python Camp requires you to work through several self-guided lessons for homework, including a handful of exercises that you will submit using the GitHub Classroom **autograder** to receive a score. The purpose of the homework is to introduce concepts, syntax, and techniques that you will use during the team activities, so it is important that everyone on the team complete the homework lessons to the best of their ability on the days they are assigned. 

The homeworks are designed to be completed individually, but you are also free to collaborate on them (including those you submit for a score). If you collaborate on the autograded homework, be sure to submit your own notebook for autograding if you want to receive the Python Camp certificate of completion.

## How Can I Make the Most of This Experience?

Following a few rules of thumb will help ensure that each team as well as the Python Camp cohort works effectively together, and that everyone has the chance to have a great learning experience. 

- Take responsibility for your own learning. You wouldn't be here if you didn't want to learn. But parts of the curriculum will probably challenge you, and you may get stuck at times. Taking responsibility for your learning means asking for help: whether of your team, of one of the Python Camp facilitators, or of someone else in the cohort. The facilitators will do their best to see that no one gets left behind, but to do this, they need your help! 
- Contribute to an inclusive, welcoming environment. Those of us who run Python Camp strongly believe not that everyone _should_ learn to code, but that everyone _can_. Many people feel that coding is not "for them" because they have received implicit or explicit messages (from peers, teachers, potential employers, popular culture, etc.) to that effect. To the extent possible, we want to counteract those messages, by providing tools people can use to learn at their own speed, and by creating an inclusive environment. Inclusive behaviors can look like
  - avoiding jargon where possible;
  - using inclusive language (and staying clear of sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist language, or other forms of language that stigmatize or exclude certain groups);
  - treating others with courtesy and respect;
  - making sure that everyone's voice is heard (and neither monopolizing the discussion nor jumping in to explain things out of turn).
- Keep open lines of communication. This may be as simple as asking "How is everyone doing on this task?" Or if you have a specific issue to raise, you might try something like, "Can we pause for a moment to talk about ________?" If you experience a problem with your team (or someone on your team) and you prefer not to raise it with them, please alert one of the Python Camp facilitators, and we will gladly work with you make things right.
