    "2. Read the section below, `Introducing the dataset`, and as a team, record any questions you have about it.\n",
    "3. Run each cell of code in this notebook (by pressing `Control` + `Enter` on a PC,  `Command` + `Return` on a Mac). The output of running the code will appear below the cell.\n",
    "4. Each cell is accompanied by annotations, and in some cases, questions for discussion. Discuss your responses to these questions with your team. The note taker should brielfy document the conversation (including any further questions or points of confusion that arise).\n",

    "#### Source\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was obtained by scraping the [GW Bookstore](https://www.bkstr.com/georgewashingtonstore/shop/textbooks-and-course-materials) website. Because web scraping is a rather advanced topic, we won't be covering that process in Python Camp.(The [code](https://github.com/gwu-libraries/python-camp/blob/main/course-utils/gw_bookstore_scraping.ipynb) is available in the Python Camp GitHup repository, for those who are interested.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was also pre-processed to simplify it somewhat (removing extraneous and redundant elements, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is in **JSON** format. JSON (usually pronounced *jay-sawn*) is a common format for sharing data on the web. It's not as concise or human-readable as some formats (e.g., CSV, which is often used for sharing tabular data). But it has a few advantages that make it popular with programmers:\n",
    " - JSON data can be deeply nested, reflecting hierarchical relationships between data elements.\n",
    " - The JSON format comprises structures that map well onto the most common data structures used by modern programming languages. \n",
    " - The JSON syntax has a lot in common with languages like Python.\n",
    " \n",
    "We'll explore these three aspects of JSON today."

The file is called `bookstore-data-cleaned.json`, where the `.json` extension indicates that this is a JSON-formatted file. (The file extension is part of the filename, like `docx` for Word documents or `.xlsx` for Excel spreadsheets.) \n",

    "The goal of this part of the discussion is to start to identify the syntactic elements of Python that allow us to model the world in certain ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "Have each team/note taker share their inventory of syntactic elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not necessary at this point to go through all of these elements in detail. Depending on the mood of the group, however, it may be useful to highlight the following (as preparation for the homework):\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Quotation marks** `''`\n",
    "    - surround strings of characters (letters, numbers, other punctuation)\n",
    "    - occuring on the left side of a colon (e.g., `title`, `isbn`), they function as field names, in Python called **keys**\n",
    "    - occuring on the right side of a colon (e.g., `CHEM`, `Organic Chemistry Model Set`), they function as field **values**\n",
    "    - also used inside square brackets (see below) to retrieve values from their fields:  `text['title']`\n",
    "    - can be single or double: makes no difference to Python\n",
    "  - **Square brackets** `[]`\n",
    "    - enclose a collection of data elements called a **list**\n",
    "    - elements of a list can be any other type of Python data, or even multiple types\n",
    "    - also used for accessing data in two ways:\n",
    "      - by position (from a list): `bkst_data[0]`\n",
    "      - by field (from a dictionary): `my_course['department']`\n",
    "  - **Curly braces** `{}`\n",
    "    - enclose a collection of data elements called a **dictionary**\n",
    "    - dictionaries have more structure than lists: each element comprises a field name (**key**) associated with a **value**\n",
    "    - square brackets are used to access dictionary values by key (see above)\n",
    "  - **Commans**\n",
    "    - used to separate elements in a dictionary or list\n",
    "  - **Parentheses**\n",
    "    - used when calling **functions**: `print(\"Hello, world!\")`, `len(bkst_data)`\n",
    "    - enclose values or variables passed to the function for processing (**arguments**)"
