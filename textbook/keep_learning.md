# Python Resources & Where to Go from Here

There are many ways to sustain and deepen your engagement with programming and the Python language beyond Python Camp. We've included examples in various media below to suit a range of learning styles. But one of the best ways to leep learning is to find practical uses for Python (or programming more generally) in your daily life.

The following are just some of the many things you can do with Python. (The links provided are merely examples and not meant to be exhaustive).

- Automate workflows involving files, directories, etc., on your computer;
- Perform data/statistical [analysis](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [machine learning](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [data visualization](https://matplotlib.org/);
- Create a [website](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/);
- Collect data from Internet sources, either by using API's or scraping web pages;
- Use [natural-language processing tools](https://spacy.io/) to analyze large amounts of text;
- Experiment with [large-language models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) and other forms of AI;
- Create [a game](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about);
- Edit audio or [video](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy).

It's hard to learn a programming language without practice, and it can be hard to practice without a context and a goal. If you don't find yourself in a context where you can work alongside others toward shared goals (e.g., a school assignment, a research project, a job), a good approach is to set a concrete, manageable goal for yourself: something you can achieve within a limited amount of time. 

For instance, if you're new to programming and have just completed Python Camp, "building an AI chatbot from scratch" might be a bit too ambitious. Ask yourself, How can I scale it down to my capacity? Maybe you can implement a Python chatbot built by someone else. (One of the advantages of Python is its popularity and the openness of its ecosystem: if you can think of a programming project, there's a good chance someone has tried it in Python and has shared the fruits of their efforts.) To stay with our example, once you get this chatbot working for yourself, maybe you can tweak the code to do something different. And as you progress, a great way to plug into a collaborative context is to contribute to open source projects: maybe the chatbot developer is accepting contributions to the codebase on GitHub, etc. 

Whatever path you take, may your journey be rewarding, and may it lead you places you had not expected to go! 

## Resources

### Books

Current GW students, faculty, and staff have access to the [Safari Tech Books/O'Reilly Library](https://go.oreilly.com/gwu-edu), which includes a vast collection of online books by major publishers on programming languages and related topics. These include titles from O'Reilly's own series, which are generally well regarded and often considered authoritative texts on a given topic.

There is no shortage of books on Python for beginners, but here are a few to consider:

- [Learning Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-5th/9781449355722/) by Mark Lutz (5th ed.). A classic -- what many a Python developer has cut their teeth on.
- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/automate-the-boring/9781098122584/) by Al Sweigart (2nd ed.). Focused on concrete, practical applications at the right scale for beginners. Also available [for free](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
- [Python Cookbook](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-cookbook-3rd/9781449357337/) by David Beazley and Brian K. Jones (3rd ed.). More of a reference book, but very useful as you progress from a grasp of the basic syntax to an understanding of the most common programming patterns. There are usually many ways to do the same thing in Python, but this book can help you identify a concise, efficient, and safe way.
- [Python Crash Course](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781098156664/) by Eric Matthes (3rd ed.) A popular book for beginners that shows up on many "Best Of" lists.
- [Head First Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-python/9781492051282/) by Paul Barry (3rd ed.). Departs from the usual exposition- and code-heavy style of most programming books with ample use of visuals and other techniques intended to make learning easier.

Additionally, there are some great open-source books available. 

- [Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html) by Melanie Walsh. This book teaches Python from the perspective of working with data in the humanities and social sciences, and it includes executable Jupyter notebooks. (The textbook for Python Camp takes a lot of inspiration from Walsh's book.)
- [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by Allen B. Downey (2nd ed.). Available in both PDF and HTML format. 


### Multimedia 

- Current GW students, faculty, and staff have access to [LinkedIn Learning](http://go.gwu.edu/linkedinlearning), which has an extensive library of video content about Python. The videos are well produced, modular, and accompanied by exercises and supplemental materials. Check out [Python Essentials](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-18764650) for an engaging place to start.
- [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) is a free Python course developed by Charles Severance. The site includes lecture videos, exercises, and an accompanying textbook.
- [Get Data off the Ground with Python](https://openedx.seas.gwu.edu/courses/course-v1:GW+EngComp1+2018/about) by Lorena Barba is a free online Python course developed at GW. The course is designed for engineering students but might be useful for anyone who wants to learn Python for data analysis. Dr. Barbra's course includes video lectures, self-paced exercises, and autograded content. (The first iteration of Python Camp was based closely on Dr. Barba's curriculum.)

### Python for Research

The [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) curriculum makes available a range of material for learning about programming in the context of specific academic disciplines. Not all of the lessons focus on Python, but many do, and they are typically geared toward beginners. If you are wondering how Python might prove useful to your research, you might find some relevant examples here.
